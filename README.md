# Nakiri Forture

*A try of HTML-CSS-JS website design and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) back-end development.*

## Link

Access the project though this link: https://nakiri-fortune.vercel.app/

## Intro

The web application randomly generates a fortune-telling image which is in a theme based on [Nakiri Ayame](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7fk0CB07ly8oSl0aqKkqFg) the Vtuber (she is really cute). 

This project is inspired by the **Vortune** plug-in from [NoneBot](https://github.com/fz6m/nonebot-plugin), a QQ-group bot project which is now suspended due to updated Tencent policies. The service is deployed on Vercel.

## Plan

- Finished:
    - Fore/back-end structure
    - Vercel serverless deployment
    - Art design (awful)
- To do:
    - Re-creation of the text resources (since the current ones are just simplified copies of Vortune resources)
    - Better art resource? (If only I have time and liver)
